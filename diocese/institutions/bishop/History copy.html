    <h2 class="section-title">The Journey of Christianity in Andhra & Telangana</h2>
    <p class="highlight">Jesus’ public ministry began with an invitation to all: <em>“The Kingdom of God is near, repent and believe.”</em> (Mk. 1:15). After His death and resurrection, He commissioned His disciples to go to the whole world and proclaim the Good News (Mk.16:15).</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Early Beginnings</h4>
    <p>Following the command of their Master, the disciples spread into different parts of the world. According to Christian tradition in South India, St. Thomas the Apostle came to our country in 52 A.D. He preached the Gospel, established Christian communities in Kerala, worked at Mylapore (Chennai), and was eventually martyred there.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">The Arrival of Missionaries</h4>
    <p>The seeds sown by St. Thomas took centuries to grow in this vast country. In 1498, Vasco da Gama’s expedition brought Portuguese Missionaries to India. More missionaries arrived later, spreading Christianity across the nation. Among them was Franciscan Missionary Luis do Salvador, who entered the Vijayanagar Kingdom and sowed the seeds of faith. Despite severe opposition, he continued his mission until he was killed in 1510, becoming the <strong>First Martyr of the Church in Andhra</strong>.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Jesuit & French Missions</h4>
    <p>In the late 16th century, Jesuits continued the Franciscan work in the Vijayanagar Kingdom. By 1689, French Jesuits started what became known as the <em>Carnatic Mission</em>, which paved the way for the establishment of the Church in Andhra.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Growth under MEP</h4>
    <p>When the Jesuits were suppressed in 1773, Propaganda Fide entrusted the Carnatic Mission to the French Foreign Missionaries of Paris (MEP). Under their leadership, the mission expanded. A notable figure was Msgr. Clement Bonnand, who arrived in 1827 to serve the Phirangipuram Mission (covering Guntur, Prakasham, and Nellore). His tireless work led to many new mission centers, which eventually required ecclesiastical reorganization.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Vicariates & Expansion</h4>
    <p>In 1832, Madras was established as a Vicariate, overseeing the entire Telugu Mission. Later, Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad were created as separate Vicariates in 1850 and 1851. The Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales (MSFS) took charge of Visakhapatnam, while the Pontificio Istituto Missioni Estere (PIME) of Milan managed Hyderabad.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">The Hyderabad Mission</h4>
    <p>Hyderabad Vicariate included all Telangana districts and parts of Coastal Andhra. The PIME Missionaries, known for leading by example, strengthened the mission further. In 1886, Hyderabad was erected as a Diocese. With the growing number of Catholics, a bifurcation became necessary.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Birth of Vijayawada Diocese</h4>
    <p>In 1933, Vijayawada was separated from Hyderabad as a <em>Sui Iuris</em> mission and officially erected as a Diocese in 1937, marking a major milestone in the spread of Christianity in Andhra.</p>
