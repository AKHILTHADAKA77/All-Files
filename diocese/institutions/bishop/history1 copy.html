    <h2>A BRIEF HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE DIOCESE OF WARANGAL</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Jesus’ public ministry began with an invitation to all,<mark>“The Kingdom of God is near, repent and believe.” (Mk. 1:15).</mark>  After his death and resurrection, He commissioned His disciples to go to the whole world and proclaim the Good News of the Kingdom (Mk.16:15). Following the command of their Master, the disciples spread into different directions of the world. According to the Christian tradition in South India, <mark> St. Thomas the Apostle came to our country in 52 A.D.</mark> and preached the Gospel, establishing Christian communities in Kerala. He also worked at Mylapore (Chennai) and was martyred there. The seeds sown by St. Thomas took centuries to grow in this vast country.

        Later, it was the expedition of Vasco da Gama in 1498 that brought along some Portuguese Missionaries to India. Since then, more and more Portuguese Missionaries came to India and spread Christianity in different parts of the country. One such Franciscan Missionary, Luis do Salvador, entered the Vijayanagar Kingdom and sowed the seeds of Christian faith. He faced severe opposition and was killed in 1510, becoming the First Martyr of the Church in Andhra. In the second half of the 16th Century, the Jesuits continued the work of the Franciscans in Vijayanagar Kingdom. In 1689, a group of French Jesuits started the Carnatic Mission, which gradually paved the way for the establishment of the Church in Andhra. After the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, Propaganda Fide entrusted the Mission to the French Foreign Missionaries of Paris (MEP) in 1776.

        Under MEP, the Carnatic Mission spread across Andhra. A key missionary, Msgr. Clement Bonnand, came to Phirangipuram in 1827, working tirelessly to expand the mission. With the growth of Christian centers, ecclesiastical reorganization was required. In 1832, Madras was erected as a Vicariate, covering the entire Telugu Mission. Later, Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad were bifurcated into separate Vicariates in 1850 and 1851 respectively. While Visakhapatnam was given to the Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales (MSFS), Hyderabad was entrusted to the Pontificio Istituto Missioni Estere (PIME) of Milan.<mark> Hyderabad became a diocese in 1886,</mark>  and with increasing Catholics and mission centers, Vijayawada was bifurcated from Hyderabad into ‘Sui Uris’ in 1933, and later erected as a diocese in 1937.
